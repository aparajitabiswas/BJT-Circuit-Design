# BJT Circuit Design (EEE 241- Assignment)
## Course Information
Course Name : Electronic Devices & Circuits I

Course Code : EEE 241  

## BJT Circuit Design Project

This repository contains the materials for my **BJT Circuit Design Assignment**. The project involves designing a **Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) circuit**, performing calculations, simulating the circuit, and analyzing its waveform.

## Project Contents:
- **Aparajita_Biswas_174 (`.tsc`)** – The simulation file for the BJT circuit.
- **Calculations** – Includes the detailed calculations.
- **Circuit Diagram Screenshot** – A visual representation of the circuit.
- **Input-Output Waveforms** – Screenshot of the circuit's waveform.
- **README.md** – This file, providing an overview of the project.

 ## Tools Used:
- **Software:** TINA-TI

## How to Use:
1. Open the `.tsc` file in **TINA-TI**
2. Run the simulation to observe the circuit’s behavior.
3. Refer to the **calculation PDF** for theoretical background.
